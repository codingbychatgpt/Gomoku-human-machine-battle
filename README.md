This is about how Gomoku huamn-machine battle achieved and the code, algorithm and related work it processes.
Introduction:
In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in mastering various board games, often outperforming human champions. One such game that has garnered interest in the AI community is Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row. Gomoku is a classic strategy game that, despite its simple rules, presents complex strategic challenges. The objective is to align five consecutive stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on a 19x19 board. This game serves as an excellent domain for exploring AI techniques due to its manageable state space and the deep strategic planning required.
In this paper, we design and implement a basic framework of Gomoku man-machine competition. Through pygame library and custom Checkerboard class, we successfully create a Gomoku game interface that can support the core functions of scoring and judging the outcome. The definition of two named tuples, Chessman and Point, makes the chess pieces and points on the board be represented in a more structured and clear way, which improves the readability and maintainability of the code.
